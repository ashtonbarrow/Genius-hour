Top ten favorite pokemon(this is my opinion)
</body>
</head>
<ul>
<h1>#10 Beedrill</h1>
<p>The reason why i like beedrill is because he can mega evolve as well as because he is a bug and a poison.This pokemon is number 10 only because he is a giant bee but the thing i don't like is he doesn't have enough attack.
<h1>#9 Rhyperior</h1>
<p>I like this pokemon because he looks so cool it looks like someone carved it out of rock and gave it a huge rock ball on it's tail.The worst thing about this pokemon is its speed needs to be higher.</p>
<h1>#8 Gyarados</h1>
<p>I like Gyarados because he is a sepintine cat creature.He has pretty good stats but he is a water flying that does not go with the water dragon pokemon that he looks like.
<h1>#7 Leavanny</h1>
<p>I like this pokemon because it knits leaves for sawaddle and it has leaf clothes.</p>
